For step 2, we could manually add the IDs as custom Markdown attributes, e.g., ## Heading 1 {#heading-id}, and then use a library like Remark-heading-id to render them into HTML. However, this approach requires manual work to add and maintain those headings. A more efficient method is to automatically generate the IDs from the heading text itself, so the heading Heading 1 will automatically receive an ID of heading-1 when transformed into HTML.

## Remark and it's plugins

Remark is an extensible Markdown processor that simplifies the process of converting Markdown files into HTML or other formats. The key aspect of Remark is its plugin-based architecture, which enables developers to extend and customize its functionality. These plugins can handle tasks like syntax highlighting, adding a table of contents, or parsing custom Markdown syntax. Integrating Remark with Next.js is straightforward â€” typically, it is used in conjunction with the getStaticProps function to process Markdown files during the build process. It can also process MDX files, making it a viable option for Next.js websites using the new "app" directory. Remark's powerful processing capabilities and seamless integration with Next.js make it an ideal choice for enhancing content and user experience in Next.js-based blogs and websites.
